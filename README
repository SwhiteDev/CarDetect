CarDetect is a free software which was written as part of a summer project at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.

The ultimate aim of CarDetect is to develop a system which can identify cars in real time video streams, and also their make and model. The system is also supposed to read numberplates and verify them with a database.

This project uses the OpenCV library for image and video processing.

What has been implemented:
Real time identification of cars is possible using the Viola and Jones method (haar cascades) implemented in OpenCV.
Multi-threaded identification for faster performance and frame-skips.
Numberplates can be read using GOCR, a free and open source OCR engine. This is in separate files; these files are not included in the CodeBlocks project file.
Similarly, PHOG method is used to detect car models. However, the code has some bugs, and I have not ironed them out. (See below)

Still to do:
Detecting car models using PHOG (pyramid histogram of oriented gradients) has some bugs. These were corrected later by someone else, but I don't have the modified code.
Real time implementation of OCR. GOCR is extremely slow and painful.
Integration of all parts of code into a complete unit.

I have no more interest in this project. This project is hereby made publicly available so that anyone in the academia or industry working on a similar project can use this code (under the terms of the GNU GPL v3 or, at his/her discretion, a higher version of the GNU GPL), thereby saving valuable time to start again from scratch.
